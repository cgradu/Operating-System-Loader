### Loader Implementation
The loader implementation spanned across multiple days, totaling approximately 10 hours of focused work, leveraging insights gained from previous labs.

Within the `segv_handler` function, responsible for handling SIGSEGV (Segmentation Fault) signals, the incoming signal information is parsed to identify the cause and context of the fault. If the signal is anything other than SIGSEGV, or if essential details are missing, the default signal handler takes over.

To handle fault addresses, we meticulously examined the file segments generated by `exec_parser`. By comparing fault addresses with segment boundaries, we determined whether a page needed to be mapped. If the fault occurred within the bounds of a segment, we mapped the page accordingly. Three scenarios guided our mapping strategy:

1. If the fault page falls between `file_size` and `mem_size`, suggesting a zero page, we mapped it as such.
2. If the fault page lies within `file_size`, we mapped it directly.
3. If the fault page spans both `file_size` and `mem_size`, we meticulously determined the portion to be mapped in memory, with the remainder filled with zeros.

This approach ensured efficient memory utilization while accurately handling fault addresses.
